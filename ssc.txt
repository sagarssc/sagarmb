File Operations:

1:) Create the following directory structure.

hello
├── five
│   └── six
│       ├── c.txt
│       └── seven
│           └── error.log
└── one
    ├── a.txt
    ├── b.txt
    └── two
        ├── d.txt
        └── three
            ├── e.txt
            └── four
                └── access.log

hello, one, two, three, four, five, six and seven are directories. The remaining items are empty files.

	mkdir hello && cd hello
	mkdir five && mkdir one && cd five
	mkdir six && cd six && mkdir seven && cd seven
	cat>error.log
	cd ..
	cat>c.txt
	cd .. && cd ..
	cd one && mkdir two && cd two && mkdir three && cd three && mkdir four && cd four
	cat>access.log
	cd ..
	cat>e.txt
	cd ..
	cat>d.txt
	cd ..
	cat>a.txt
	cat>b.txt 

2:)    Print the locations of all the txt files in hello and its subdirectories.

	find . -type f -name "*.txt"


3:)   Delete all the files with the .log extension.

	find . -type f -name "*.log" -delete



4:)    Add the following content to a.txt

	zip -r hello.zip hello  

6:)     Copy all the contents of hello into another directory called world

	mkdir world
	cp -r hello world/
